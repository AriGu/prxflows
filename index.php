                  <strong>1. Smoother Workflow:</strong> This portal is meant to be a one-stop shop for all the communications about clouds that are currently being initiated via email or tickets.
                  <br><br>
                  <strong>2. Increased Visibility:</strong> Here you can view, track and change statuses on all current and former clouds. 
                  <br><br>
                  <strong>3. Coordination and Consistency:</strong> When updates are made, notifications with links and instructions are send to each party. The result is that all data is current and consistent for all participants.
